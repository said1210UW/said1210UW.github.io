Every ten years, each state undergoes district division to elect members of Congress. The use of advanced mathematical techniques has empowered map-drawers to gain substantial political leverage. These tools also enable quantification of partisan favoritism within electoral maps. With the following project , we aimed to explore these mathematical tools, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo and generative AI, while conducting an analysis of the current electoral map of Washington state.
