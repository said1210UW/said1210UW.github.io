Every ten years, each state undergoes redistricting to elect members of Congress. The use of advanced mathematical techniques has empowered map-drawers to gain substantial political leverage. These tools also enable the quantification of partisan favoritism within electoral maps. In this project, we aimed to explore these mathematical tools—such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo and generative AI—while conducting an analysis of the current electoral map of Washington state.
