**CurrencyExchange API**: 
Provides information regarding exchange rates of a given currency relative to the United States Dollar. The data used in this project was retrieved from sources such as the currency flags at [TransferWise Currency Flags](https://github.com/transferwise/currency-flags/) and currency information at [Open Exchange Rates - Currencies](https://openexchangerates.org/api/currencies.json).
  
**Project Features**:
  - Created an API calculating currency exchange rates with respect to the United States Dollar.
  - Includes a client-side application that allows users to enter the amount of US dollars they want to exchange and convert it to the selected foreign currency.
